## Description

**Taxi24_BE** is a backend RESTful API built for Taxi24, a startup aiming to revolutionize transportation by providing a white-label fleet management solution. This project is the result of a technical test to demonstrate backend design, domain modeling, and REST API development skills.

### What is Taxi24_BE?
Taxi24_BE exposes a set of APIs that allow other companies to manage their fleet of drivers and passengers, and to handle trip assignments efficiently. The project is built using Node.js with NestJS and TypeScript, and uses PostgreSQL as the database.

### Main Features
- **Drivers:**
  - List all drivers
  - List available drivers
  - Find available drivers within a 3km radius of a location
  - Get driver by ID
- **Passengers:**
  - List all passengers
  - Get passenger by ID
  - For a passenger, get the 3 closest available drivers
- **Trips:**
  - Create a new trip (assign driver to passenger)
  - Complete a trip
  - List all active trips
  - List all trips

### Technical Test Context
- Built as a single NestJS service (Node.js, TypeScript)
- Follows RESTful design and best practices
- Demonstrates domain modeling, code quality, and use of known REST patterns
- Includes seed data, SQL schema via TypeORM, and a clear README
- Extra points for tests and Clean Architecture principles
- No authentication/authorization required
- API documentation available at `/api` via Swagger

## Project setup

1. Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Copy the example environment file and configure your database credentials:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` as needed for your local PostgreSQL setup.

3. Run the database (PostgreSQL) locally. You can use Docker, for example:

```bash
docker run --name taxi24-postgres -e POSTGRES_USER=taxi24_user -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=taxi24_pass -e POSTGRES_DB=taxi24_db -p 5432:5432 -d postgres
```

## Compile and run the project

```bash
# development
npm run start

# watch mode
$ npm run start:dev

# production mode
$ npm run start:prod
```

## Run tests

```bash
# unit tests
$ npm run test

# e2e tests
$ npm run test:e2e

# test coverage
$ npm run test:cov
```

## Deployment

When you're ready to deploy your NestJS application to production, there are some key steps you can take to ensure it runs as efficiently as possible. Check out the [deployment documentation](https://docs.nestjs.com/deployment) for more information.

If you are looking for a cloud-based platform to deploy your NestJS application, check out [Mau](https://mau.nestjs.com), our official platform for deploying NestJS applications on AWS. Mau makes deployment straightforward and fast, requiring just a few simple steps:

```bash
$ npm install -g @nestjs/mau
$ mau deploy
```

With Mau, you can deploy your application in just a few clicks, allowing you to focus on building features rather than managing infrastructure.
