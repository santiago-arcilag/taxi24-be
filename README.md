# Taxi24_BE: Backend API for Taxi24 Technical Test

## Project Purpose
This project implements a backend RESTful API for Taxi24, designed to serve as a white-label fleet management solution. It was developed as a technical test to demonstrate:
- API design and RESTful best practices
- Domain modeling for drivers, passengers, and trips
- Use of Clean Architecture principles
- Code quality, modularity, and maintainability

## Requirements Coverage
**All requirements from the technical test are addressed:**
- CRUD endpoints for drivers, passengers, and trips
- Nearby driver search (within 3km)
- Trip assignment and completion
- 3 closest drivers for a passenger
- Data model clarity and SQL schema (via TypeORM entities)
- Seed data for demonstration
- No authentication/authorization (as requested)
- Frequent, descriptive git commits
- API documentation via Swagger at `/api`

## Main Features
- **Drivers:**
  - List all drivers
  - List available drivers
  - Find available drivers within a 3km radius
  - Get driver by ID
- **Passengers:**
  - List all passengers
  - Get passenger by ID
  - Get 3 closest available drivers for a passenger
- **Trips:**
  - Create a new trip (assign driver to passenger)
  - Complete a trip
  - List all active trips
  - List all trips

## Key Technical Decisions
- **NestJS + TypeORM:** Chosen for modularity, scalability, and rapid development.
- **PostgreSQL:** Used for relational modeling and geospatial queries.
- **Clean Architecture:** Each domain (drivers, passengers, trips) is a separate module with its own entities, services, and controllers.
- **Environment Configuration:** Supports both local (Docker/Postgres) and cloud (Railway, Render, etc.) deployments using `.env` variables and `DATABASE_URL`.
- **Validation & Error Handling:** DTOs with `class-validator` and `ValidationPipe` ensure robust input validation; controllers return proper HTTP status codes and error messages.
- **Seed Data:** A script (`src/seed.ts`) populates the DB with demo data for immediate testing.
- **Swagger/OpenAPI:** Full API documentation is auto-generated and accessible at `/api`.

## How Requirements Were Met
- **No authentication/authorization:** All endpoints are public as requested.
- **SQL schema:** The TypeORM entities (`driver.entity.ts`, `passenger.entity.ts`, `trip.entity.ts`) define the schema and auto-generate tables.
- **Frequent commits:** Every meaningful change is committed with a descriptive message.
- **Testing:** Includes unit tests and is ready for further test expansion.

## Project setup

### What is Taxi24_BE?
Taxi24_BE exposes a set of APIs that allow other companies to manage their fleet of drivers and passengers, and to handle trip assignments efficiently. The project is built using Node.js with NestJS and TypeScript, and uses PostgreSQL as the database.

### Main Features
- **Drivers:**
  - List all drivers
  - List available drivers
  - Find available drivers within a 3km radius of a location
  - Get driver by ID
- **Passengers:**
  - List all passengers
  - Get passenger by ID
  - For a passenger, get the 3 closest available drivers
- **Trips:**
  - Create a new trip (assign driver to passenger)
  - Complete a trip
  - List all active trips
  - List all trips

### Technical Test Context
- Built as a single NestJS service (Node.js, TypeScript)
- Follows RESTful design and best practices
- Demonstrates domain modeling, code quality, and use of known REST patterns
- Includes seed data, SQL schema via TypeORM, and a clear README
- Extra points for tests and Clean Architecture principles
- No authentication/authorization required
- API documentation available at `/api` via Swagger

## Deployment (Railway)

This project is deployed using [Railway](https://railway.app/), a cloud platform for Node.js apps with integrated PostgreSQL support.

### How Railway Deployment Works
- The GitHub repository is connected directly to Railway.
- A virtual machine running Node.js 20+ is selected for the service.
- Environment variables (including `DATABASE_URL` for PostgreSQL) are configured in the Railway dashboard.
- **Continuous Deployment:** Every commit to the `master` branch automatically triggers a new deployment version.
- Railway builds and starts the app using your `package.json` scripts (`npm run build` and `npm run start:prod`).
- The API and Swagger documentation are available at the public Railway URL (e.g., `https://your-app.up.railway.app/api`).

**No manual deployment steps are needed after initial setupâ€”just push to `master`!**

## Local development setup

If you want to run the project locally for development:

1. Clone the repository and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Copy the example environment file and configure your database credentials:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   Edit `.env` as needed for your local PostgreSQL setup.

3. Run the database (PostgreSQL) locally. You can use Docker, for example:
   ```bash
   docker run --name taxi24-postgres -e POSTGRES_USER=taxi24_user -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=taxi24_pass -e POSTGRES_DB=taxi24_db -p 5432:5432 -d postgres
   ```

4. Start the app:
   ```bash
   npm run start:dev
   ```

## Compile and run the project

```bash
# development
npm run start

# watch mode
$ npm run start:dev

# production mode
$ npm run start:prod
```

## Run tests

```bash
# unit tests
$ npm run test

# e2e tests
$ npm run test:e2e

# test coverage
$ npm run test:cov
```
